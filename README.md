Bystander intervention in medical emergencies can often have lifesaving effects. Gathering information, talking to witnesses, and making sure the area is safe for everyone are all important tasks for bystanders. However, without proper training, many individuals do not know how to help and are hestinant to step in.
Our goal was NOT to teach bystanders to diagnose and treat medical emergencies. Rather, we produced this app  to provide the public with a tool â€” a tool that will enable an untrained bystander to prevent the situation from worsening and to gather important information which will help medical professionals. Additionally, many of our other functionalities will help individuals in other aspects of accessing health services on the WashU campus.
We are excited for the great changes that this application will bring. We hope that WashU students, staff, and faculty feel more excited about getting involved and being outstanding members of this vibrant community!
